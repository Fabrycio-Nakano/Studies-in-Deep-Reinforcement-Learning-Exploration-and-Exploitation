# Studies-in-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Exploration-and-Exploitation

# Introduction

Hello, my name is Fabrycio, and I am a researcher specializing in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This repository contains the assets, code, and documentation related to my work and studies for the final project of my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence. My focus has been on exploring the foundational principles and advanced techniques in DRL while applying them in practical scenarios using state-of-the-art tools and environments.

## About Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning combines reinforcement learning principles with deep neural networks to solve complex decision-making problems. A key aspect of DRL is the balance between **exploration** and **exploitation**:

- **Exploration** involves trying new actions to discover potentially better strategies. This is crucial in environments where the optimal policy is not immediately evident.
- **Exploitation** focuses on leveraging known strategies to maximize rewards based on current knowledge.

In my studies, I experimented with different exploration strategies, such as:
- **Îµ-Greedy Exploration**: A simple approach where actions are mostly exploitative, but random actions are occasionally chosen to ensure exploration.
- **Entropy Regularization**: Encourages diversity in action selection by maximizing the policy's entropy.
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Uses additional reward signals derived from the agent's curiosity or novelty of states.

These exploration techniques played a critical role in improving the learning efficiency and robustness of the agents in various environments.

## Tools and Environments

For this project, I utilized two powerful tools that significantly enhanced my understanding and application of DRL:

1. **TextWorld**  
   TextWorld is a framework for generating and interacting with text-based games, which are challenging environments for reinforcement learning agents due to their high-dimensional, partially observable state spaces. I used TextWorld to explore natural language understanding in DRL, focusing on tasks such as navigation, object interaction, and logical reasoning within textual descriptions.

2. **ML-Agents**  
   ML-Agents, developed by Unity, provides an interactive platform to train DRL agents in diverse 3D environments. Using this tool, I developed agents capable of solving complex tasks requiring spatial reasoning, multi-agent collaboration, and dynamic decision-making. The visual and customizable nature of ML-Agents allowed me to experiment with unique scenarios and evaluate the scalability of my approaches.

## Objectives of this Repository

This repository serves as a consolidated resource for:
- Code implementations of various DRL algorithms and exploration strategies.
- Experiments conducted in TextWorld and ML-Agents environments.
- Documentation and insights derived from my research and learning journey.
- Assets and configurations used for simulations and model training.

Through this work, I aim to demonstrate the potential of DRL in addressing complex problems and provide a foundation for future research in the field. I hope this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in DRL, natural language processing in games, and the integration of AI with interactive simulation platforms.
